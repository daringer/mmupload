Add bugs/todos here (change order for priority)

- (mobile) resize (??) happens already, does it?!


- create new/empty file

- https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload

- on "rename" enter/esc should do the right thing => ok / cancel

- Communications:
	-> generic json-received data handler
	   -> parse for "state", react accordingly
		 -> parse for "msg"
		 -> any non-fail is the only function-callback to be provided here

  -> generic ajax-sending (??) somehow not, but might be necessary due to
	   json-receiver generalization ???

	->


- Database:
	=> CRITICAL: MAIN FLAW: currently too many users on the same mmupload instance
		 will likely break the yaml-db-file due to possible parallel reads/writes

	-> YAML is somehow nice, but also sucks like hell, I see two ways from here:
	   => keep it as simple as it is now and just change the following:
		    - more convinience features despite load_config/save_config, especially
					more granulation in loading & saving
				- be multi-threading-safe by either
					(1) "locking the .yaml" file, "with" access only on the db (slow but
						  can be accelerated using a stack of files, if the main db-file is
							locked too long, messy...)
					(2) keep the db in mem (share data accross all/many wsgi/flask
					    threads/procs(?)) + ensure thread-safety on mem-data, dump data
							regulary and on events/trigger

		 => go the bigger loop and search for an one-file-yaml-database abstraction
		    library (does this exist?), features needed:
				-> thread-safe db access
				-> no extra daemon/process, must run within any thread as library
				-> minimalistic querying capabilities (in fact dict()-api is enough)
				-> ....
